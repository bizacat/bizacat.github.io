                <p>
                    Austin-based running group Trail Roots focuses on training for both road and trail races for groups and individuals. The existing website
                    was there, but information was hard to find and things that founder and owner Erik Stanley wanted to highlight to visitors weren't anywhere
                    to be seen on the home page. We worked out what the main functions were to be of the new site, and broke everything down into Training, Maps, and
                    Travel categories, with potential to add Races in the future when those were established. Branding and logos already existed, so I developed
                    the site to emphasize the warm, earthy vibe the organizer wanted to reinforce in his business.

                    During my final four semesters of school, I worked on side projects with CreditDonkey.com founder Charles Tran. He contacted me after
                    discovering my winning infographic entry into a 99designs.com competition and asked me to help design infographics for his website's blog.
                    Other freelance writers and researchers helped collect the data and topics behind each infographic, which often paired with another article on
                    the same subject, and I helped create the visuals, the data representation, and the narrative behind them.

                <p>
                    My first job at Pointserve: Design the new logo using the new name.  I wasn't told what the company did and the website did little to help me
                    understand.  I was given a set of branding colors to go from, a proposal logo from one of the VPs of a cell tower with a signal. I had 4 separate
                    meetings with the stakeholders and VPs regarding the logo design and 5-6 iterations (some vastly different from the other) to narrow down what
                    it was they were looking for since I was given free reign of the design in the beginning. Ultimately it was settled that a road was a key identifier
                    that they wanted used in the logo design.

                    Done during 2010–2011 during the summers. For all but Semester 6, the projects took the entire semester. An initial design problem selected by the
                    professor was established with program needs and rough estimates of square footages in some cases. Then began a research phase where we studied the site,
                    the conditions, the use-cases and audience, and then developed a design <span style="font-style: italic;"> parti (defined as the chief organizing
                thought or decision behind an architect's design presented in the form of a basic diagram and / or a simple statement).</span> Construction documents,
                    renderings, physical and digital models, and other representations of the ideas were composed and presented in front of a review of critics
                    of varying backgrounds and professions.

                    99designs is a website driven by companies in search of logos, marketing material, websites, and more looking for the best available talent.
                    Each design need is packaged as a contest with design brief where any designer can participate in and submit their designs. The chosen
                    winners immediately can collect the prize money for their designs and exchange the final material with the contest-creator. It was a great opportunity
                    to try my hand at new design briefs and get some of my work out in public and win my first income as a designer in college. Through 99designs I was
                    discovered by CreditDonkey.com to design infographics and later help them out with their UX.

                <h2>Architectural Photography</h2>

                    During my final semester at IIT, I took a transformative architectural photography elective that I didn't need to graduate. I learned the functional
                    use of a DSLR as well as compositional strategies related to photos of buildings and spaces, from conveying use of space without even showing a single
                    person in the photo from illuminating the circulation through the space with composition alone.
