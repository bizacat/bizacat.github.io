        <h1>A New mobiCorp.com</h1>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>
            mobi is a Software as a Service (SaaS) developer for service and delivery businesses that operate fleets of vehicles. mobi provides a suite
            of applications ranging from GPS tracking, route optimization, to analytics to help manage and improve operations for these industries.
        </p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
            The existing website has a lot of valuable information on it, a separate page for every product and all of the solutions, many benefits, a
            blog, a knowledge center, and much more content.
        </p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
            There are too many choices and information overload. Much of the information remains outdated and the organic traffic to the
            site is followed by a high bounce rate and little retention. mobi also developed more refined sales and marketing strategies in other areas
            of the company and so it makes sense to reflect this in their website.
        </p>

        <h2>Identifying the problem</h2>
        <h4>Identifying that there is a problem</h4>
        <img src="/img/mobi-old-home-ss.jpeg">
        <p class="caption">The old mobicorp.com</p>
        <p>
            We long knew there were issues with the current website– one of the biggest obstacles we have yet to overcome is clearly conveying the who and the
            what (and the why) of mobi. The site receives little traffic, which stems from other issues such as poor SEO, indexing, lack of marketing
            campaigns, external driving forces from salespeople in the field, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, using google analytics we also understood that there was a <strong>very high bounce rate</strong> and the few who did interact with the website
            for any other reason than to go straight to the about/careers/management pages <strong>were not following any channels that we want them to</strong>
            (fill out a form for a free demo or a quote/OSA).
        </p>
        <p>
            There were loosely defined goals we knew we wanted fulfilled but had neglected to outline a direct path towards how that is to be achieved from an
            organic experience (no salesperson leading the way for the user).

        <h2>What the existing home page does not do well:</h2>
        <ul class="negative">
            <li>The hero image has no representation of what we do</li>
            <li>The video release (see the show) is 2 years old and has unclear interactive intentions with unknown consequences</li>
            <li>No supportive text or headlines that tells us exactly what mobi is or provides without confusing jargon</li>
            <li>Too many options in the navigation and on the page leading to overchoice or choice paralysis.</li>
            <li>No clear call to action or obvious next steps.</li>
            <li>Content breadth is extremely large and takes some scanning (and patience) to get the gist of mobi</li>
            <li>User feedback studies resulted in many responses indicating that they thought mobi dealt with data, streaming, video, or other unrelated services</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What it does do well:</h2>
        <ul class="positive">
            <li>Uses recognizable customer logos to help establish credibility and trust (mentioned during a video interview with a user)</li>
            <li>One person who was video interviewed skimmed the benefits in search of what mobi is all about and honed in on the particular
                benefit <span class="italic">“Manage your fleet. Monitor drivers and manage assignments”</span> concluding that the company deals with fleets of vehicles</li>
            <li>Another interviewee saw the screenshots and understood that mobi deals with maps (but thought mobi was just a mapping/routing company)</li>
            <li>Yet another interviewee scrolled all the way to the bottom and clicked on one of the videos that had nothing to do with mobi,
                but was evidence that they were more likely to play a video easily accessible from the webiste (as opposed to the hidden American Dream videos).</li>

        <h2>The top fold: Making the seconds count</h2>
        <h4>No room for fluff</h4>
        <img title="A new header image, headline, subheadline, and shorter navigation options" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mobi-homepage-hero.jpg">
        <p class="caption">The proposed new design</p>
        <p>
           The number one task that needed to be addressed was the first thing a new visitor sees– the hero image, the headline, the most important call
            to action (CTA), and clean navigation.
        </p>
        <h3>The hero image</h3>
        <p>
            Captures the visual nature of mobi's services. Serves as an eye-catching device to draw attention and keep it. An asymmetric weight of the image
        helps frame the next key information appropriately.
        </p>
        <h3>The key information (headline and subheadline)</h3>
        <p>Explains exactly what mobi is. No fluff.</p>
        <h3>The clean navigation</h3>
        <p>
            Previously, there were 9 options in the navigation. With dropdowns, there were 46 options. Now there are are 4 main options for new users,
            an additional navigation menu that is separate and clearly related to existing users' needs.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mobi-new-navigation.jpg">
        <p class="caption">Less main navigation options with more defined sub-link descriptions helps users make a more informed and quicker decision</p>
        <h3>The CTA</h3>
        <p>
            So the user sees some cool videos or reads a quick blurb about the company– now what? Now there's a direct link to the request a demo form at
            the bottom of the page.

        <p class="caption">The content immediately below the top fold</p>
        <p>
           As mentioned before, the marketing material of mobi has evolved over time and work had been done in all other formats except on the main
            website. Plenty of impromptu discussions and formal meetings took place to discover the best ways to present mobi's products and the plethora
            of information behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It made sense to reuse a lot of the existing ideas sensibly, gathering the best concepts that helped define what mobi does, who the
            solutions are for, and how they can benefit their users in ways that sets mobi apart from the competition.

        <h2>Joe the Plumber</h2>
        <h4>Movie? What movie?</h4>
        <img title="mobi Playbill" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mobi-old-playbill.jpg">
        <p class="caption">The playbill on the old homepage: Links to multiple chapters of the video, including the "Full Feature" that uses all of the chapters</p>
        <p>
            The videos starring Joe "The Plumber" originally featured on the homepage's hero image do a great job of describing how mobi works
            out in the field and how it helped Joe's plumbing company excel in many areas. Unfortunately, the link was not obvious, and things got even more
            confusing once the user did decide to click on the link.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the redesign the video is no longer head and center at the top of the page. However, it is prominently displayed in its own section
            further down the page for those who have already committed to spending time on the page and are looking to know more about mobi. Now, rather
            than making the choice to go to a new, unknown location and then having to pick from an arbitrary list of videos, the user makes
            the simple decision of whether or not to hit play.
