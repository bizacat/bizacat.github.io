        <h2>Identifying the problem</h2>
        <h4>Identifying that there is a problem</h4>
        <p>
            We long knew there were issues with the current website– one of the biggest obstacles to overcome is clearly conveying the who and the
            what (and the why) of mobi. The site had/has little traffic, which stems from other issues such as poor SEO, indexing, lack of marketing
            campaigns, external driving forces from salespeople in the field, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, using google analytics we also understood that there was a very high bounce rate and the few who did interact with the website
            for any other reason than to go straight to the about/careers/management pages were not following any channels that we want them to (fill
            out a form for a free demo or a quote/OSA).
        </p>
        <p>
            There were loosely defined goals we knew we wanted fulfilled but never outlined a direct path towards how that is to be achieved from an
            unguided experience (no salesperson leading the way).

        <h2>Doing the research</h2>
        <h4></h4>
        <p>
            There was already a monolithic routing UI contained in an application dubbed ESO.  Setting up users was a several-weeks long process where the
            company would even send employees across states or across the country to their customers to help them set up their fleets and enter in all of their data.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/eso-ui.png">
        <p>
            The UI was no less complicated.  With pages among pages of huge lists with many checklists and difficult to understand fine-tuning adjustments to be
            made (many of the company's employees didn't even know what some of the functions were), the app was a pain to use for all involved.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            Once set up,
            however, some of the company's largest customers saved thousands to millions a year and believed it all to be worth-it.

        <h2>What the existing home page does not do well:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The hero image has no representation of what we do</li>
            <li>The video release is 2 years old and has unclear interactive intentions</li>
            <li>No supportive text or headlines that tells us exactly what we do without confusing jargon</li>
            <li>Too many options in the navigation and on the page leading to overchoice or choice paralysis.</li>
            <li>No clear call to action or obvious next steps.</li>
            <li>Content breadth is extremely large and takes some scanning (and patience) to get the gist of mobi</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What it does do well:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses recognizable customer logos to help establish credibility and trust (mentioned during video interview)</li>
            <li>One person who was video interviewed skimmed the benefits in search of what mobi is all about and honed in on the particular
                benefit “Manage your fleet. Monitor drivers and manage assignments” concluding that the company deals with fleets of vehicles</li>
            <li>Another interviewee saw the screenshots and understood that mobi deals with maps (but thought mobi was just a mapping/routing company)</li>
            <li>Yet another interviewee scrolled all the way to the bottom and clicked on one of the videos that had nothing to do with mobi,
                but was evidence that they were more likely to play a video easily accessible from the webiste (as opposed to the hidden American Dream videos).</li>

            I worked primarily with the <strong>project manager</strong> (PM) who first corresponded with the <strong>executive team</strong> to get an overhead grasp of what the business goals were.
            Both the executives and PM gathered what the demands were of existing and customers-to-be and listened to what their pain points had been over
            the years of working with the existing planning and routing platform that the company originally built. After the first wireframes are put together,
            the executives, PM, and I all meet on multiple occasions to discuss the wireframes and come up with further solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the needs and designs of the new routing app were settled on, it was on to the <strong>development team</strong> to implement the new project.  The dev
            team at my company is agile and works on 4-5 week milestones of a set of deliverable functionality, features, or defect/support fixes.
            They have 2 week iterations within these for demos with the entire company. Daily stand-up discussions in the morning are followed by a tech huddle for the
            dev team to discuss the day's tasks and an afternoon checkpoint to discuss and road blocks or challenges during the day.
