        <h2>The company</h2>
        <h4>Background story</h4>
        <p>
            The company I work for full-time builds software for GPS tracking, efficient routing and planning, and analytics.  They offer their
            software as a service (SaaS) with a full suite of modular web-apps to customers in the field-service and delivery industries
            who have fleets and service orders to manage.</p>
        <p>
            Founded in 1996, the company developed an ahead-of-its-time OP (optimization platform) to crunch the numbers and help businesses intelligently
            schedule appointments, make routes, and track their daily performance to see where they can cut costs and improve their operations.</p>

        <h2>What I inherited</h2>
        <h4>Existing or past solutions</h4>
        <p>
            There was already a monolithic routing UI contained in an application dubbed ESO.  Setting up users was a several-weeks long process where the
            company would even send employees across states or across the country to their customers to help them set up their fleets and enter in all of their data.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/eso-ui.png">
        <p>
            The UI was no less complicated.  With pages among pages of huge lists with many checklists and difficult to understand fine-tuning adjustments to be
            made (many of the company's employees didn't even know what some of the functions were), the app was a pain to use for all involved.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            Once set up,
            however, some of the company's largest customers saved thousands to millions a year and believed it all to be worth-it.

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <h4>Make it better!</h4>
        <p>
            In more recent times, the company decided to take a new approach to their business strategy– they already had a handful of large enterprise
            companies that gave them a steady flow of income.  The problem was, they wanted to increase their revenue and bringing on more of these monolithic
            companies took months to up to a year and were difficult to come by and set up.  They wanted to branch out to small/medium businesses and thus needed
            a smaller, more lightweight and less complex solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            They wanted a new <strong>simple routing web-app</strong>.

        <h2>The team</h2>
        <h4>Dynamics and integrating across departments</h4>
        <p>
            I worked primarily with the <strong>project manager</strong> (PM) who first corresponded with the <strong>executive team</strong> to get an overhead grasp of what the business goals were.
            Both the executives and PM gathered what the demands were of existing and customers-to-be and listened to what their pain points had been over
            the years of working with the existing planning and routing platform that the company originally built. After the first wireframes are put together,
            the executives, PM, and I all meet on multiple occasions to discuss the wireframes and come up with further solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the needs and designs of the new routing app were settled on, it was on to the <strong>development team</strong> to implement the new project.  The dev
            team at my company is agile and works on 4-5 week milestones of a set of deliverable functionality, features, or defect/support fixes.
            They have 2 week iterations within these for demos with the entire company. Daily stand-up discussions in the morning are followed by a tech huddle for the
            dev team to discuss the day's tasks and an afternoon checkpoint to discuss and road blocks or challenges during the day.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h4>Who am I designing for?</h4>
        <p>
            Due to the small size of the company, getting to work with people who already had inside knowledge and experience working with the customers
            we were developing the solution for was an easy convenience.  A lot of the systematic and functional requirements came from the initial
            meeting among executives, feedback from our sales team in the field, and the PM.
        </p>
        <img title="Route survey: gathering user feedback on an existing app" src="/img/route-survey.png">
        <p>
            Additional information was gathered from:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competitor research</strong>: Our industry advantage was that our competitors do one thing or the other (GPS tracking, but not routing, etc.)
                , while we offer every solution as a modular create-your-own package unique to each business.
                We had to figure out ways in which we could do things better, which first involved making sure we were at least offering the basics
                of what everyone else was offering.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry standards and existing methodologies</strong>: Similar to competitive research, ensuring that our routing app workflow was not
                so drastically different from what users were already doing. We didn't want it to be so unfamiliar that it'd be difficult for users to integrate into their daily rituals.</li>
                <li><strong>User feedback</strong>: Talking to our support team and salespeople was a great source of existing user feedback.  Understanding
                pain points, what they did and didn't like about our existing solutions, what was confusing and unintuitive to a first-time user, and what
                competitors were doing right or wrong gave me clues about what did or didn't need to be included.  I also began the process of creating
                <strong>user feedback surveys</strong> to gather input as we planned future updates to the app.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Iterating</h2>
        <h4>Trimming or amputating?</h4>
        <img src="/img/ux-wireframes.png" title="First route wireframes">
        <p>
            I work initially with pen & paper or a combination of in-browser modifications and Adobe Illustrator wireframes and mockups. My first
            step is usually to use one or the other to lay out the framework of all the functional requirements given to me by the PM after we've sat down
            to discuss each of the needs and use cases.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/ux-route-sketches.jpg" title="Hand sketches done for new pick-up and drop-off requirements">
        <p>
            The first phase of the routing app was to produce the <strong>MVP</strong> (Minimum Viable Product), which meant establishing what the essentials
            were. I had to keep in mind any technical and especially time limitations while balancing all of that with delivering an excellent user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rough wireframes detailing all of the basic functionality were created, merged together in an Adobe Acrobat PDF or in a prototyping app like Invision
            so that page-linking could easily be added for an interactive walkthrough.  I showed the basic wireframe to our PM and we talked about what was feasible, any changes that needed to be
            made, and how to further break down the features into separate phases as more development time was devoted to the app in the future after the MVP was released.
        </p>

        <span class="caption">New mockups of additional features to the existing Route application</span>
        <p>
            I went through several iterations and meetings with the executive team, PM, and lead developers where we hashed out new wireframes and then mockups,
            developed with the existing branding and UI artifacts used in our other apps. Design iterations occurred frequently and both in formal and informal
            meetings and chats. During these meetings I often have the wireframes, notes, or mockups in Illustrator and we make changes and adjustments on the fly to keep the discussion going without having to end the meeting and reconvene later.

        <h2>Design Implementation</h2>
        <h4>The case for designers who code</h4>
        <img src="/img/dev-team-working.png">
        <p>
            On a daily basis, devs <strong>form pairs</strong> to tackle one card per set and trade places the next day while one person anchors a
            card to share knowledge. When it came time to implement the new UI and interactions, I would pair with developers and lead with implementation
            of the <strong>HTML</strong> (a taste of foundation grids and modals with a whole lot of scratch-made patterns), <strong>CSS</strong> (Sass),
            and any <strong>Javascript</strong> necessary.  Working this closely with the developers helped me implement the designs in ways that were
            stable and foundational, making future changes and additions to the UI easy for me or other designers, and were modular and easily hooked
            up to the back end, making the developer's lives easier too.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            Working with the development team on more technical issues also helped me better understand any interactive and design limitations, so I
            became a more responsible and adaptable UX designer.

        <h2>But wait, there's more!</h2>
        <h4>Always evolving</h4>
        <p>
            Like most things in the digital world these days, the product keeps evolving. New companies with business requirements that our app doesn't
            yet support pop up.  The executives want the app to cover a broader spectrum of companies with larger fleets and more complicated daily
            processes. New features must be added and some of the complexities of the grandfather route app, ESO, must be translated into the new clean UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The updated challenge is to satisfy these specific customers along with the internal business demands, while retaining the initial spirit
            and successes of the app. This often means holding back from merely adding more more more, which had lead to the downfall of ESO.
            Compromises must be negotiated on both sides (simplicity vs. abundance).
