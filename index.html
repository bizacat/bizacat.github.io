            No matter the title, my primary role is always that of a visual communicator.  From good visual communication comes clarity of complexity.
            When large data and intricate concepts can be condensed into big picture summaries, these ideas are transformed into accessible information.
            Only once the big picture is understood can the details be analyzed.

        <p>
            My goal is to always grasp the overall idea or problem and transfer the knowledge to others easily so a conversation can be encouraged:
