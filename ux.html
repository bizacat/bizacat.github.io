    <h1>Route Planning and Dispatching</h1>
    <h2>UX Evolution</h2>

    <p>
        Intending to serve small to medium sized delivery and field service businesses, mobi decided to create a new web-app to tackle the challenge of efficient route planning. Initially the needs were straightforward:
        The app would be lightweight and simple to use, with only 3 route goal settings to choose from– a tremendous step down in complexity from mobi’s enterprise routing tool, ESO.  The choices are: Minimize Distance, Minimize Late Time, and a combination of the two.
